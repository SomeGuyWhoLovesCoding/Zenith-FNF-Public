Welcome to the FNF Zenith scripting API!

## Requirements

CPPIA: It's there to replace hscript at the cost of compiling the script's source code to a cppia file, and the ability to make it the entire modpack that you can store your embedded files in.

# Notice

You may not release the source of your Friday Night Funkin' Zenith mod publicly. [Read the license for more details.](https://github.com/SomeGuyWhoLovesCoding/Zenith-FNF-Public/blob/main/license.md)

## Guide

I kinda hated learning how to get a cppia script working and it'll feel complicated at first. But, you'll get it by just compiling the script's source to generate a .cppia file, and then compiling the game. The `scriptablee` define is automatically inputted via Project.xml.

Compile the cppia script source code using ``haxe --cppia script.cppia`` (You can call the file extension zfm, zfmp, or whatever like zenith_mod, mod, zenith, zf, etc.) and just send the file on gamebanana, gamejolt, or somewhere else like an exteral link, so that people can download it, put it at the root folder of fnf zenith, open the app, and load the mod that has just been added onto the mod menu so that the title screen boots.
