Welcome to the FNF Zenith modding API!

## Requirements

ModPacker: It's there to replace hscript at the cost of compiling the source code which is a single hx file, along with a few files (such as embed.xml) to a zfmp file, and the ability to make it the entire mod pack that you can store your raw embedded data in.

# Notice

You may not release the source of your Friday Night Funkin' Zenith mod publicly. [Read the license for more details.](https://github.com/SomeGuyWhoLovesCoding/Zenith-FNF-Public/blob/main/license.md)

## Guide

Just compile modpackTemplate with your custom assets.

# Final message

I hope you enjoyed this!
