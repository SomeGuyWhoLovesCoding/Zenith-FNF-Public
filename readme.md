# Frequently asked questions

1st Q: How do I play FNF Zenith on linux?

1st A: To test this engine on there, you must have a computer of that operating system. To compile it, install the dependencies required to compile and do ``haxelib install hxcpp``, then ``lime test target`` or ``haxelib run lime test target``. Replace "target" with your computer's operating corresponding to the target.
