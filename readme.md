This engine offers ultra performant, cross-platform, and very clean gameplay in mind and has global scripting support, a brand new chart editor, and minimal screen tearing when not on vsync. **WARNING: Won't be fully compatible with MacOS, as it's still untested!!!**

**We recommend you to use latest Haxe.**
