# Welcome!

This engine offers ultra performant, cross-platform, and *clean* gameplay experience in mind and has global scripting support.

**WARNING: This project won't be fully compatible with MacOS as it's still untested!!!**

**WARNING 2: I'll be doing some weird stuff with code to get maximum performance.**

**So, if some stuff gets vile and causes a crash, undo what you've changed. The commits can be reverted in the repository if you are actually contribute to this project.**

**Also, we recommend you to use Haxe 4.2+. (Read the description of the Emitter haxelib)**
